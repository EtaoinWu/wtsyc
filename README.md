# What The SysY Compiler

This is a simple work-in-progress compiler for the [SysY](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/sysy/) language.

## Credits
The [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library is used. Lexer is generated by [Ragel](https://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/). Many inspirations from [this repo](https://github.com/jez/ragel-bison-parser-sandbox).
