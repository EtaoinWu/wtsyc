# What The SysY Compiler

This is a simple work-in-progress compiler for the [SysY](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/sysy/) language.

## Credits
* The [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library is used.
* Lexer is generated by [Ragel](https://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/).
* Many inspirations from [this repo](https://github.com/jez/ragel-bison-parser-sandbox) for front end.
* Argument parsing provided by [argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse).
* JSON is used internally for states, and [this awesome library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) is used.
* Functional data structures provided by [libf++](https://github.com/GJDuck/libf).
